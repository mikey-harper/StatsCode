# Create function to install packages

This is Luke Blunden's really nice function for installing packages that can't be loaded. Use with caution in a script which may not have internet access...

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# This is a function to install any packages that cannot be loaded
myRequiredPackages <- function(x,y){
  for( i in x ){
    #  require returns TRUE if it was able to load package
    if( ! require( i , character.only = TRUE ) ){
      #  If package was not able to be loaded then re-install
      install.packages( i , repos=y , 
                        #type="win.binary" , comment out so runs on OS X etc
                        quiet=TRUE , dependencies = TRUE , verbose = FALSE )
      #  Load package after installing
      require( i , character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE )
    }
  }
}
```

#Load required libraries

```{r echo=TRUE}
# warning=FALSE, message=FALSE
# the options above suppress/show any warnings & messages
# call the function my_required_packages
myRequiredPackages(c("car", 
                     "data.table", # fast data munching
                     "knitr"
                     ),"http://cran.rstudio.com/")
```

Packages used:

 * car - [@car]
 * data.table - [@data.table]
 * knitr = [@knitr]

Check they were loaded:

```{r }
print(search())
```
