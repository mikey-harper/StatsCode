# About this document

Document last refreshed: `r Sys.time()`

This document was created using [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr) in [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com). Knitr supports the embedding of R statistical analysis code within markdown text documents allowing them to be updated and re-run. Things to note:

* Knitr will display warnings (but not errors) from R. The warnings may or may not be important to the interpretation of the results;
* Knitr is very clever but it does not always support pretty tables.

This work was funded by XXXX.
