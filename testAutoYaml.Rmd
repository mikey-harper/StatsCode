# Purpose

To test [auto-inclusion](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html#shared_options) of the `_output.yaml` file.

Anything below (within) the `output:` container seems to be OK in the yaml file. But not title, author etc. not the bibliograpphy option. Which is a bit of a pain...

Key packages used:

 * base R - for the basics [@baseR]
 * knitr - to create this document [@knitr]
